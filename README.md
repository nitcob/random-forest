Random forest classifiers

Another approach to predictive modeling is to use decision trees. Decision trees map observations to conclusions about those observations' target values.

Goals
  - Understand decision trees and how to use them to make predictions.

  - Introduction to problems where the number of attributes is too large, or the attributes are too difficult to interpret, to determine from domain knowledge alone what features are most important for inclusion in a model.

  - Implement a random forest algorithm.
